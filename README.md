# VSCode Extension: React Component Creator Wizard

## Description
This Visual Studio Code extension helps you create a folder and file structure for React components quickly and efficiently. It provides context menu commands to generate the necessary files and folders for a new React component, ensuring consistency and saving development time.

## Features
- Create a new React component structure with a quick operation - right clicking in the folder you want your component, choose a name, and that's it. 
- Customize the file extensions and styles used in the component structure.
- Optional support for Storybook and Unit Tests (React Testing Library).

## Example of Structure Result
```bash
SomeFolder [e.g. components]
â”‚
â”‚â”€â”€ MyComponent [Folder]
      â”‚
      â”‚â”€â”€ index.{jsx | tsx}
      â”‚
      â”‚â”€â”€ MyComponent.{jsx | tsx}
      â”‚
      â”‚â”€â”€ MyComponent.styles.{js | ts | css | scss | sass}
      â”‚
      â”‚â”€â”€ MyComponent.stories.{jsx | tsx} [optional]
      â”‚
      â””â”€â”€ MyComponent.test.{jsx | tsx} [or inside a __tests__ folder] [optional]
```

## How to Use
1. Right click on a folder in the Explorer view (`SomeFolder` in the exemple above).
2. Select `Component Creator Wizard` to generate a new component structure.
3. This will open the VS Code's `Command Palette`, at the top of VS Code editor.
4. There, give your component a name and press `Enter`.
5. Your component is created! ðŸ¥³ ðŸŽ‰

Your component has been created with the default options. But you can have options other than the initial default, as we'll see in a moment.

## Installation
1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
3. Search for `React Component Creator Wizard`.
4. Click `Install` to install the extension.
5. Reload Visual Studio Code to activate the extension.

## Configuration
You can customize the default file extensions and styles used in the component structure by modifying the default extension settings.
1. Right click on any folder in the Explorer view.
2. Click on `Customize Default Settings...`.
3. This will open the VS Code's `Command Palette`, at the top of VS Code editor.
4. Choose `TypeScript` or `JavaScript` as the component language.
5. Then choose what kind of styling you will use in the component.
6. Note that there is an `Ask on component creation` option. By selecting it, you will not set any styling strategy as default. Instead, you will select the style type only when you are creating a component.
7. After choosing one of the style options, you will ask about unit tests. Choose one option.
8. And so one.
9. At the end of the process, the new default values are set and will be used when creating the next components.
